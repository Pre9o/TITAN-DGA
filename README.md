# TITAN DGA

This repository contains the **dataset generated by TITAN DGA** and a near future, will contain the code, introduced in the paper:  
> **“TITAN DGA: Enhancing DGA Evasiveness Through a Transformer-based Autoencoder and Adversarial Self-Augmentation”**  
> Presented at the *21st International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM 2025), Bologna, Italy.*

## Overview

TITAN DGA is a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** enhanced with a **Transformer-based Autoencoder** and **adversarial Self-Augmentation** mechanisms for creating realistic and evasive *Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)* samples.  

This dataset is intended for **training, validation, and evaluation** of DGA detection models under **adversarial and realistic Internet-like conditions**.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is composed of **synthetic adversarial domains** generated by TITAN DGA after the Retraining stage.  

| Subset | Description | Example Use |
|:-------|:-------------|:------------|
| `titan_dga/` | Domains generated by TITAN DGA model. | Adversarial domain detection training. |
| `titan_dga_s2r/` | Domains generated using *Synthetic-to-Real* ratios (0.1–1.0). | Evasion robustness experiments. |

Each file will be provided in **CSV format**, with the following structure:

```csv
label, dga type, domain
benign, none, example.com
dga, titan, nationalcityshopi.tech
